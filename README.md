**handwrittenDigitRecognition**


Recognize the human handwritten digits from different sources like images, and classify them into 10 predefined classes or numbers between 0 - 9.
the model for prediction uses conv2D and Maxpool2D as two layer to predict and also flatten for converting the 2D arrays from the maxpool layer and dropout for preventing overfitting .
